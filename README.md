# TO-DO App

## Introduction
This project implements the Front-End for a simple To-Do List web application, using the React JS library, and also Styled Components replacing pure CSS. It includes the login page and the general UI of the app. The login authentication logic and the tasks database for each user are not implemented, since this project aims to be a Front-End study only.

## Functionalities
- Application UI with navigation sidebar and area for the to-do list;
- Add new task, setting name and category properties;
- Delete task, with a modal for confirming the action;
- Check task as done via checkbox;
- Filter tasks showing in the to-do list by "done", "not done" or "all";
- Filter tasks showing in the to-do list by their category, via selecting on the sidebar;

**Note:** Currently, the "edit task" and adding or removing categories functionalities are not implemented, since I considered it wouldn't contribute that much to my personal learning, and would be very time-consuming. Maybe I'll implement this later on.
